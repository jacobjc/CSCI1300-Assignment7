//Originally I used my split function again to run this method, however COG didn't like that so I had to switch to a string
//stream which also works.
//Firstly, it removes all punctuation and uppercase letters from the string that it took in.
//Then it will parse the array of words to check if it already exists.
//If it does exist, then it will take that index#, and add one to the value at the index# of counts array.
//If it doesn't exist, then it add it to the array at index# (which would be the next available space). Then it will add one to the value at the index# of counts array. Then it will increment index#.
//Since it is void, it doesn't return any values. However, the scope of the arrays is in the entire function, so the arrays are changed outside of the function.
